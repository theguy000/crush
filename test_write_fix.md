# Write Tool Fix Test

This document describes the fix for the issue where the main TUI was not showing the correct content after editing in the permissions dialog.

## Problem Description

When a user:
1. Types "write t.txt with hello"
2. The write tool is used and permissions dialog opens showing "hello"
3. User presses Edit and changes "hello" to "hello 123"
4. User saves the edit
5. The diff view correctly shows "hello 123"
6. But in the main TUI, it still shows "hello" instead of "hello 123"

## Root Cause

The issue was that the write tool renderer and formatWriteResultForCopy methods were using the original `params.Content` from the tool call input, but they should be using the actual content that was written to the file after the user's edits.

## Solution

1. **Enhanced Permission Service**: Added `RequestWithUpdatedParams()` method that returns the updated permission parameters after user edits.

2. **Updated Write Tool**: Modified the write tool to use `RequestWithUpdatedParams()` and write the actual edited content to the file.

3. **Enhanced Response Metadata**: Added `FilePath`, `OldContent`, and `NewContent` fields to `WriteResponseMetadata` to include the actual content that was written.

4. **Updated Renderers**: Modified both `writeRenderer.Render()` and `formatWriteResultForCopy()` to use the metadata content instead of the original parameters.

## Files Modified

- `internal/permission/permission.go`: Added `RequestWithUpdatedParams()` method
- `internal/llm/tools/write.go`: Updated to use new permission method and enhanced metadata
- `internal/tui/components/chat/messages/renderer.go`: Updated writeRenderer to use metadata
- `internal/tui/components/chat/messages/tool.go`: Updated formatWriteResultForCopy to use metadata

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Run the application
2. Type "write test.txt with hello"
3. When permissions dialog opens, press 'E' to edit
4. Change "hello" to "hello world"
5. Press Shift+Tab to focus buttons, then press Enter on Save
6. Press 'A' to allow the write operation
7. Verify that the main TUI now shows "hello world" instead of "hello"
