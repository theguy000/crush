# Crush API Key Input Paste Crash Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis
- Crush crashes when using Ctrl+V to paste API keys in the API key input dialog
- The crash occurs specifically when the cursor loses focus during paste operations
- This is a critical usability issue as API keys are long tokens that require copy-paste functionality

## Root Cause Investigation
- [x] Analyze the textinput component from bubbles library for paste handling
- [x] Examine cursor focus management during paste operations
- [x] Identify potential race conditions or state inconsistencies
- [x] Check for error handling gaps in paste message processing

## Solution Strategy
- [x] Implement robust error handling for paste operations
- [x] Add cursor focus preservation during paste
- [x] Implement fallback paste handling mechanisms
- [x] Add logging for debugging paste-related issues
- [x] Test paste functionality with various API key formats

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Modify APIKeyInput component to handle paste operations more robustly
- [x] Add panic recovery for paste message handling
- [x] Implement cursor focus restoration after paste
- [x] Add validation for pasted content
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for paste functionality

## Testing Plan
- [x] Test Ctrl+V with various API key lengths
- [x] Test paste operations during different input states
- [x] Test paste with special characters in API keys
- [x] Test paste when cursor focus is lost
- [x] Test paste with empty clipboard
- [x] Test paste with non-text clipboard content

## Quality Assurance
- [x] Ensure no regression in existing functionality
- [x] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [x] Test on different terminal types and operating systems
- [x] Validate that the fix doesn't introduce new crashes
