# Crush Paste Functionality Fix

## Problem Description

Users reported that when trying to paste API keys using Ctrl+V in the Crush application, the application would freeze and become unresponsive. This was particularly problematic when entering long API keys that are impractical to type character by character.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was identified in the API key input handling within the TUI components. The problem appeared to be related to:

1. **Focus Loss**: The textinput component was losing focus during paste operations
2. **Event Handling**: Inadequate error handling for paste events
3. **Clipboard Access**: Potential race conditions when accessing the clipboard

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Paste Event Handling

Added specific handling for `tea.PasteMsg` events in the `APIKeyInput` component with:
- Focus restoration before paste operations
- Fallback clipboard access using the `atotto/clipboard` package
- Better error recovery mechanisms

### 2. Ctrl+V Keyboard Shortcut Support

Added explicit handling for Ctrl+V keyboard events to provide a more reliable paste mechanism:
- Direct clipboard access when Ctrl+V is detected
- Focus maintenance during paste operations
- Graceful error handling

### 3. Panic Recovery

Implemented panic recovery mechanisms to prevent application freezing:
- Deferred panic recovery in paste operations
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks when clipboard access fails

### 4. Improved TextInput Configuration

Enhanced the textinput component configuration:
- Removed character limits for API keys
- Set appropriate default width
- Better focus management

## Files Modified

1. `internal/tui/components/dialogs/models/apikey.go`
   - Added enhanced paste event handling
   - Implemented Ctrl+V keyboard shortcut support
   - Added panic recovery mechanisms
   - Improved textinput configuration

2. `internal/tui/components/dialogs/models/models.go`
   - Added Ctrl+V handling in the models dialog
   - Enhanced paste event routing

3. `internal/tui/tui.go`
   - Added Ctrl+V handling in the main TUI
   - Improved paste event routing

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start Crush: `crush`
2. Select Grok LLM when prompted
3. When the API key input dialog appears, try Ctrl+V to paste your API key
4. Verify that:
   - The application does not freeze
   - The API key is pasted correctly
   - The cursor remains focused on the input field

### Debug Logging

The fix includes debug logging to help troubleshoot any remaining issues. Look for log messages starting with "DEBUG:" to track paste operations.

### Test Script

Run the provided test script:
```bash
./test_paste.sh
```

## Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- ✅ Ctrl+V works reliably for pasting API keys
- ✅ Application does not freeze during paste operations
- ✅ Cursor focus is maintained
- ✅ Long API keys can be pasted without issues
- ✅ Graceful error handling if clipboard access fails

## Compatibility

This fix is compatible with:
- Ubuntu Desktop (tested)
- Other Linux distributions
- The existing Crush codebase
- All supported LLM providers

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
1. Visual feedback during paste operations
2. Paste history for frequently used API keys
3. Secure clipboard clearing after paste operations
4. Additional keyboard shortcuts for common operations
